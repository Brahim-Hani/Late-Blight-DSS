In this file we are going to explain the general layout of the system , and then how to successfully run it .

1 - How is the project built? 
	The project has three sections :
	
		a - ROS System : 
			The workspace that contains all the packages is named "ros2_blight_ws" , inside of it you can see the source folder "src" , this folder contains all the ros2 packages needed for 
			the system. 4 Total packages are built : blight_detector (AI) , weather_reporter (Forecasts) , spray_scheduler_pkg , spray_decider,  inside of each there are our 4 nodes that 
			construct the system .
		b - Web Setup : 
			The workspace that contains all the web files is named "Farm_contro_panel" , inside of it you can see three four of files : html , css , js files and the images used.
		c - ROS - WEB Comms : 
			There are two launchers : websocket launcher for web connection with rosbridge and the nodes launcher (launches all four nodes when called).
			and than we get to the python file that controls the system ( starts and pauses ) named "backend.py" . 

2 - How can you start the system? 
	This steps assume that the user has already installed linux as the OS preferably Ubunti 20.04 ( Jammy ) . 
	
	First step is installing ROS2 :
		sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
		sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

		echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] \
		http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME") main" | \
		sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop -y
		echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc
		sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions -y
	
		A - Install libraries and dependancies with terminal commands :
			Python 3.11.3 : 
				sudo apt update
				sudo apt install python3
				
			OpenCV : 
				sudo apt update
				sudo apt install python3-opencv
			
			Ultralytics :
				sudo apt update
				sudo apt install python3-pip
				pip3 install --upgrade pip
				python3 -m venv yolo-env
				source yolo-env/bin/activate
				pip install ultralytics

			Requests :
				pip3 install requests
			
			Websocket : 
				pip install websocket-client
				pip install websockets
			
			psutile :
				pip3 install psutil

			Flask :
				pip3 install flask
				
			Flask_cors :
				pip3 install flask-cors

		B - Run the websocket launcher : 
			ros2 launch spray_scheduler_pkg rosbridge_alone.launch.py
		C - Launch the website ( open the farm.html file )
		D - Launch the backend python file : 
			navigate to the directory of the backend.py and run it :
			python3 backend.py
	Now you can start the system from the start button on the website , make sure you are connected to the internet connection to get the scheduling to work (weather data need internet) .
